Original code was written by Youtuber, Code With Antonio, on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aeMRB8LL4o&ab_channel=CodeWithAntonio)

This repository is intended for me to document my steps following Antonio's tutorial as well as learning a framework. It's not intended to use for commercial purposes. The Stripe API that will be later implemented is only used for learning purposes, and using my own money for myself.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
