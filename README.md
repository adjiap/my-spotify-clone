# Introduction
Original code was written by Youtuber, CodeWithAntonio, on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aeMRB8LL4o&ab_channel=CodeWithAntonio), though it was created using Node.js 14 and [React](https://react.dev/) framework

This repository is intended for me to document my steps following Antonio's tutorial as well as learning a framework. It's not intended to use for commercial purposes. The Stripe API that will be later implemented is only used for learning purposes, ~~and using my own money for myself~~ (I later found out, that you don't need any :D).

 I thought it would be educational for anyone that is "intermediate enough" to recognize what to do, without looking at what Antonio did, and so I left the release tags. Each release tags, would mean the release of new features in application, based on the original youtube video.
